Things to consider:

    User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
    Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
    Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
    Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
    Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
    Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
    Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
    Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
    Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features
to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and
caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

You can use DOM methods and JavaScript, to listen to user events and manipulate
the DOM by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting specific elements in the
user interface. DOM manipulation allows you to not only target specific
elements, but also change their style and content.

DOM is the tree structure holding your elements..
    Javascript manipulates the DOM to change how your page is
    displayed/acts
